    "summary": "The aim of this paper is to predict the popularity of news articles for which we have made use of mashable dataset. The paper successfully implements and compares eleven models and found that Gradient Boost works the best on the Online News Popularity dataset with an accuracy of 79.7. Taking the mean of the shares of all the articles the study concludes that articles with more than 3395 shares are considered popular. The paper provides a detailed analysis of all the models and presented a table at the end comparing the results.",

    "summary": "This paper overviews different algorithms used in blink detection. The various phases in this system are image capture, face detection, eye localization and finally blink detection. The standard algorithms for each phase have been discussed. We have proposed a method for blink detection using convolutional neural network to detect the eye states and predict the blinks. Finally, a comparison of our method is made to the other methods of detecting blinks in both still images and live video feed scenarios.",
